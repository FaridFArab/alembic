    :tags: bug, autogenerate
    :tickets: 264

    The autogenerate process will now apply the :meth:`.Operations.f` modifier
    to the names of all constraints and indexes that are reflected from the
    target database when generating migrations, which has the effect that these
    names will not have any subsequent naming conventions applied to them when
    the migration operations proceed.  As reflected objects already include the
    exact name that's present in the database, these names should not be
    modified.   The fix repairs the issue when using custom naming conventions
    which feature the ``%(constraint_name)s`` token would cause names to be
    double-processed, leading to errors in migration runs.
