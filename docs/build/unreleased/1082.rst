    Added optional :pep:`621` support to Alembic, allowing all source code
    related configuration (e.g. local file paths, post write hook
    configurations, etc) to be configured in the project's ``pyproject.toml``
    file.   A new init template ``pyproject`` is added which illustrates a
    basic :pep:`621` setup.

    Besides being better integrated with a Python project's existing source
    code configuration, the TOML format allows for more flexible structures,
    allowing configuration items like ``version_locations`` and
    ``prepend_sys_path`` to be configured as lists of path strings without the
    need for path separator characters used by ``ConfigParser`` format.   The
    feature continues to support the ``%(here)s`` token which can substitute
    the absolute parent directory of the ``pyproject.toml`` file when
    consumed.

    The :pep:`621` feature supports configuration values that are relevant to
    source code organization and generation only; it does not accommodate
    configuration of database connectivity or logging, which remain under the
    category of "deployment" configuration and continue to be part of
    ``alembic.ini``, or whatever configurational method is established by the
    ``env.py`` file.   Using the combination of ``pyproject.toml`` for source
    code configuration along with a custom database/logging configuration
    method established in ``env.py`` will allow the ``alembic.ini`` file to be
    omitted altogether.
