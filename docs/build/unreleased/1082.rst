    Added optional :pep:`621` support to Alembic, where a subset of the
    project-centric configuration normally found in the ``alembic.ini`` file
    can now be retrieved from the project-wide ``pyproject.toml`` file.   A new
    init template ``pyproject`` is added which illustrates a basic :pep:`621`
    setup.  The :pep:`621` feature supports configuration values that are
    relevant to code locations and code production only; it does not
    accommodate database connectivity, configuration, or logging configuration.
    These latter configurational elements remain as elements that can be
    present either in the ``alembic.ini`` file, or retrieved elsewhere within
    the ``env.py`` file.   The change also allows the ``alembic.ini`` file to
    be completely optional if the ``pyproject.toml`` file contains a base
    alembic configuration section.
