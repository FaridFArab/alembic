    Add "module" post-write hook. This hook type is almost identical to the
    console_scripts hook, except it's running ``python -m black`` instead of
    using black's ``console_script``. It is mainly useful for tools without
    console scripts (e.g. ruff), but has semantics closer to the
    console_scripts hook in that it finds the ruff module available to the
    running interpreter instead of finding an executable by path. Pull request
