    Fixed autogenerate rendering bug which failed to render foreign key
    constraints local to a :class:`.CreateTableOp` object if it did not refer
    to a ``MetaData`` collection via a private constructor argument that would
    not ordinarily be passed in user-defined rewriter recipes, including ones
    in the Alembic cookbook section of the docs.
