    :tags: bug, autogenerate
    :tickets: 1656

    The :meth:`.Operations.execute` operation when rendered in autogenerate
    (which would necessarily be only when using a custom writer that embeds
    :class:`.ExecuteSQLOp`) now correctly takes into account the value
    configured in :paramref:`configure.alembic_module_prefix` when rendering
    the operation with its prefixing namespace; previously this was hardcoded
    to ``op.``. Pull request courtesy Avery Fischer.
