    The ``pyproject.toml`` file used by the Alembic project itself for its
    Python package configuration has been amended to use the updated :pep:`639`
    configuration for license, which eliminates loud deprecation warnings when
    building the package.   Note this necessarily bumps setuptools build
    requirement to 77.0.3.
