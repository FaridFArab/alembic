    Added new option to the ConfigParser (e.g. ``alembic.ini``) configuration
    ``path_separator``, which supersedes the existing ``version_path_separator``
    option.  ``path_separator`` specifies the path separator character that
    will be recognized for both the ``version_locations`` option as well
    as the ``prepend_sys_path`` option, defaulting to ``os`` which indicates
    that the value of ``os.pathsep`` should be used.

    The new attribute applies necessary os-dependent path splitting to the
    ``prepend_sys_path`` option so that windows paths which contain drive
    letters with colons are not inadvertently split, whereas previously
    os-dependent path splitting were only available for the ``version_locations`` option.

    Existing installations that don't indicate ``path_separator``
    will continue to use the older behavior, where ``version_path_separator``
    may be configured for ``version_locations``, and ``prepend_sys_path``
    continues to be split on spaces/commas/colons.  A deprecation warning
    is emitted for these fallback scenarios.

    When using the new ``pyproject.toml`` configuration detailed at
    :ref:`using_pep_621`, the whole issue of "path separators" is sidestepped
    and parameters like ``path_separator`` are unnecessary, as the TOML based
    configuration configures version locations and sys path elements as
    lists.
