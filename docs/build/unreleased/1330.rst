    Added new option to the ConfigParser config (typically via ``alembic.ini``)
    ``path_separator``. This new option supersedes the previous similar
    option ``version_path_separator``.   The new ``path_separator`` option
    applies to the path splitting mechanism of both the ``version_locations``
    option as well as the ``prepend_sys_path`` option, and in newly
    rendered ``alembic.ini`` files will use the value ``os``, which means to
    use the operating system path separator when splitting these string values
    into a list of paths.

    The new attribute applies necessary os-dependent path splitting to the
    ``prepend_sys_path`` option so that windows paths which contain drive
    letters with colons are not inadvertently split, whereas previously
    os-dependent path splitting were only available for the
    ``version_locations`` option.

    Existing installations that do not have ``path_separator`` present
    will continue to make use of ``version_path_separator`` when parsing the
    ``version_locations`` option, or splitting on spaces / commas if
    ``version_path_separator`` is also not present.  ``prepend_sys_path`` will
    continue to be split on spaces/commas/colons if ``path_separator`` is
    not present.   Under all of these fallback conditions, a deprecation
    warning is now emitted encouraging to set ``path_separator``.
