    Added new :meth:`.CommandLine.register_command` method to
    :class:`.CommandLine`, intended to facilitate adding custom commands to
    Alembic's command line tool with minimal code required; previously this
    logic was embedded internally and was not publicly accessible.  A new
    recipe demonstrating this use is added.   Pull request courtesy Mikhail
    Bulash.
