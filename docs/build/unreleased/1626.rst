    Added :paramref:`.Operations.add_column.if_not_exists` and
    :paramref:`.Operations.drop_column.if_exists` to render ``IF [NOT] EXISTS``
    for ``ADD COLUMN`` and ``DROP COLUMN`` operations, a feature available on
    some database backends such as PostgreSQL, MariaDB, as well as third party
    backends.  The parameters also support autogenerate rendering allowing them
    to be added to autogenerate scripts via a custom :class:`.Rewriter`.  Pull
