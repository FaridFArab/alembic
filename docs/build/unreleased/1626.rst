    :tags: usecase, autogenerate, postgresql

    Added :paramref:`.Operations.add_column.if_not_exists` and
    :paramref:`.Operations.drop_column.if_exists` to render ``IF [NOT] EXISTS``
    for ``ADD COLUMN`` and ``DROP COLUMN`` operations, a feature available on
    some database backends such as PostgreSQL, MariaDB, as well as third party
    backends.  The parameters also support autogenerate rendering allowing them
    to be turned on via a custom :class:`.Rewriter`. Pull request courtesy of
